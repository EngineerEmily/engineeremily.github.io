<p>The Tech’s educational offerings are expanding at lightning speed, with programs every day in our new 3,000-square-foot studio.</p>

<p>This year we are introducing The Tech Studio 2.0, an expansive space dedicated to design-based learning programs. Hands-on activities were once something visitors could experience only during limited times and days, but our merger of the previous Tech Studio space and Hands-On Science Workshop has changed all that.</p>

<p>At the new studio, we invite guests to participate in daily programs and activities, most of which are drop-in and free with museum admission.</p>

<p><b>Engineering for Earthquakes:</b> Inspired by this year’s Tech Challenge, this interactive program allows visitors to explore their inner engineers by constructing a model structure and testing it at an earthquake-simulation table. </p>

<p><b>Makerspace programs:</b> From trash-grabbers to paper circuit switches, these open-ended design challenges engage visitors in the design process by using familiar objects in new and creative ways. </p>

<p><b>Open design programs:</b> These programs offer visitors free-form, imaginative, yet tangible constructionist learning experiences using loose objects. Some activities are created in-house and some are from educational kits such as Imagination Playground blocks, Thinker Linkers, Bloom the Game, and ITSPHUN geometric pieces.</p>

<p><b>Saturday workshops:</b> Our Art + Tech workshops offer in-depth experiences with an emphasis on design thinking. Guests receive personalized, take-home projects on topics like sewing circuits, paper circuits, coding, soldering, and more.<p>

<p><b>Hack-a-thons:</b> Weekend-long marathons of design and innovation, hack-a-thons are special events that engage the community in an extended experience. We’ve hosted both kid-focused events (Hack the Future, HacKid) and adult-focused events (Bay Area Makers Startup Weekend, VTA’s Hack My Ride), turning dreamers into doers.</p>

<p><b>Sunday partner programs:</b> Local and national partners such as MakerEd, Wonder Workshop, Benesse, AgIC, and CodeMonkey showcase new educational products or workshops. Beta Jams, an especially popular program series, provide new and experienced designers the opportunity to prototype their educational or ed-tech products with museum visitors. </p>

<p><b>Special workshop series:</b> Frequent workshop series complement new exhibit openings. These coincide with The Tech’s exhibit calendar; registration and fee required.</p>

<p><b>Social Innovation Workshops:</b> Part of The Tech Awards program, these free quarterly workshops for teens emphasize technology and social issues. Application required.</p>

<p><b>Seasonal initiatives:</b> Throughout the year The Tech joins in various national and global celebrations, including Computer Science Education Week and the Hour of Code (December) and National Engineers Week (February). During the holidays we offer special programming to entertain the whole family, including guest favorites such as Turkeys Take Flight and Flying Fruitcakes, in which participants create a flying machine to launch holiday food into an oven!</p>
