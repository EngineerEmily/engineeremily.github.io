<p>On three special days this spring, thousands of children from schools that serve low-income families will descend upon The Tech for field trips with all the bells and whistles. They’ll participate in a science lab, see an educational IMAX movie, and enjoy lunch out. Even the bills for transportation and food have been taken care of by one of our most dedicated corporate sponsors: Google.</p>

<p>"Google is proud to support an organization that encourages young minds to use technology to solve the world’s most pressing problems," said Joe Kava, Tech board member and Google’s vice president of data centers.</p>

<p>Google Field Trips are just one of many ways the global tech giant supports the museum. Altogether, the company has donated more than $1 million that has helped fund The Tech’s Smart Museum initiative and The Tech Awards.</p>

<p>During the national Hour of Code in December, Google volunteers helped museum visitors explore Blockly, a series of visual games that teach programming. Volunteers from Google have also shared their business expertise, including two who donated more than 100 hours of their time to help craft a business plan for The Tech’s new evening meet-up series, Creative Collisions, that will launch in 2015.</p>

<p>"We can’t say enough about the caliber of volunteers from Google who are actively involved with The Tech," said Linda Tsai, foundations relations director. "Their commitment to our mission of helping others realize their potential in science and engineering is remarkable and evident in the halls of the museum."</p>

<p>More than a million visitors have also had the chance to digitally explore all corners of the globe thanks to a Google-donated exhibit that surrounds guests with seven large-scale monitors displaying Google Earth. </p>

<p>"Google employees are inspired when they volunteer at the museum, and we look forward to one day recruiting the young visitors just starting to build their skills in innovation," Kava said.</p>
